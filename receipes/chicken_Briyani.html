    <span>Then it's god grace</span>
    <p>
        Once you have your chicken marinated, rice and fried onions ready, start by cooking the marinated chicken. 
        To cook the chicken, place it in the utch oven or a large pot that you plan to use for cooking the biryani, and cook them for 7 minutes. There is no need to stir the chicken, only flip it once around the 4 minute mark.

        The final step is layering with 70% cooked basmati rice. 
        Sprinkle saffron milk and ghee on top and cover tightly with a lid. 
        Originally, the pot was sealed with dough to prevent steam from escaping, 
        but a tight lid works just as well. It's important to cook this on a low flame 
        so that the heat distributes evenly and the bottom doesn't get burnt.
